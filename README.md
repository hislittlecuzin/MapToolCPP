# MapToolCPP
Open Source map tool for upcoming game


This is the open source map tool. 

This tool was written with SFML 2.5.0 64 bit in Visual Studio 2017 community.

To save & load files, it's recommended to copy the directory then type "/filename.txt" afterwards. 

Example:
1. Navigate to documents folder in file explorer
2. copy directory
3. Open map tool
4. edit map by using function keys & left mouse button
5. go to console & type "SAVE"
6. Type "DIR"
7. paste directory (ex: "C:/users/name/documents")
8. Type / filename.txt (Finished example "F:/documents/NewMap.txt) //Note that the C:/ Drive may not save your files. 

Same process works for loading.

Forward slashed & back slashes can be mixed.
